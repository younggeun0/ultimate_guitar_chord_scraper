As well as give the correct chords, i thought i'd give a set of chords
which sounds better when playing an acoustic version! You can obviously
still use the correct chords with an acoustic guitar but the changes
are suttle and so without the other instruments it just doesn't sound
as good!

how many special people change?  how many lives are living strange?

where were you while we were getting high?
 A                               A7sus4
  slowly walking down the hall, faster than a cannon ball
 A7                                   Em7
where were you while we were getting high?
